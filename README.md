# Expo Android Build Failure: Missing Dependency Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when building an Android app using the Expo CLI. The build process fails with an ambiguous error related to a missing dependency, despite the dependency being present in the project's `package.json`.

## Bug Description

The primary issue involves the Expo CLI's Android build process failing to correctly identify and utilize a project dependency.  The error message is often insufficient to diagnose the underlying problem.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to build the Android app using `expo build:android`.
4. Observe the error message related to a missing or incorrectly configured dependency.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect dependency installation:** Although the dependency is listed in `package.json`, there might be issues with its actual installation.
* **Caching issues:** Expo CLI's build cache might be corrupted.
* **Android build configuration:** A problem could exist within the Android build configuration itself.
* **Gradle issues:** Gradle problems in the Android build environment.

## Solution

The solution may involve clearing the cache, reinstalling dependencies, or checking the Android build configurations for any inconsistencies. Detailed solutions are provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.
