The solution to this problem often involves a combination of steps. First, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed by running `expo install` or `npm install` or `yarn install` again after clearing the npm cache using `npm cache clean --force`.  If this doesn't resolve the issue, cleaning the Expo build cache is crucial. This can be done by deleting the `.expo` folder within your project directory. Then, try building again. If the issue persists, there might be a problem in the Android build configuration, in which case carefully examining your `android` folder in the project and `gradle` files is required. Finally, if the issue is related to Android's Gradle configuration, you may need to update Gradle, clear its caches, or even check the Android SDK for possible problems.
